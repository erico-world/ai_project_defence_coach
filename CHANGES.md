### 2. VAPI SDK Enhancement

- Updated `lib/vapi.sdk.ts` to implement a more robust initialization pattern
- Added detailed error handling and logging for better debugging
- Implemented client-side only execution to prevent server-side errors
- Enhanced VAPI event listeners to provide more context during errors
- Used lazy initialization to ensure proper setup sequence

### 3. Agent Component Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in the `handleCall` function

### 5. Added Troubleshooting Tools

- Created `scripts/check-env.js` to validate environment variables
- Added comprehensive `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide for common issues
- Updated `package.json` with troubleshooting and environment check scripts

## Technical Changes

### Client-Side Only Execution

Added checks throughout the codebase to ensure browser-only code doesn't execute on the server:

```javascript
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  // Browser-only code here
}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling

Implemented more robust error handling patterns:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might fail
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Detailed error info:", error);
  // User-friendly error message
  let errorMessage = "An error occurred. Please try again.";
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    errorMessage = `Error: ${error.message}`;
  }
  toast.error(errorMessage);
}
```

### Improved Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track application flow and identify issues:

```javascript
console.log("Starting defence session with variables:", {
  questions: formattedQuestions
    ? "Formatted questions available"
    : "No questions available",
  projectTitle: projectDetails?.projectTitle,
  academicLevel: projectDetails?.academicLevel,
});
```

## New Developer Tools

- `npm run check-env` - Verify all environment variables are set
- `npm run troubleshoot` - Check environment and start dev server
- `npm run clean` - Clear cache for a fresh start

These changes significantly improve the reliability and debuggability of the application, particularly focusing on the Firebase and VAPI integration issues that were causing the errors.
